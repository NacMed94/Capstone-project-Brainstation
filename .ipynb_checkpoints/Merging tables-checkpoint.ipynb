In the table above, the first three rows show the first stay of patient 100000032. They arrived in the ED, where they spent 6 h, they were then transferred to the transplants care unti and were discharged after a day. As we want to predict the destination care unit for each transfer we should probably change the organisation of this df by adding the original care unit of the next transfer as a column of the previous row. This column, which we will call \"event\" will be our class (the outcome we want to predict). This way we can delete all discharge rows which are redundant anyway. \n",

The care unit and outtime null values are probably related to the discharge events (above we saw that discharge events have no care unit). Let's convert the datetime columns to datetime. It does not make much sense exploring these as they are as the dates are randomised to deidentify the data. The dates for each patient are consistent, though, so we can use them to extract duration for example or to sort events for a given patient. We can create this new feature now"
